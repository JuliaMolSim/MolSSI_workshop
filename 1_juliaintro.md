#### Julia Basics

- Welcome to the REPL

> Julia's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive command-line interface that allows users to execute Julia code in real time. It supports multiple modes, such as the default mode for executing Julia code, the package manager mode (accessed by pressing `]`), shell mode (accessed by `;`), and help mode (accessed by `?`). The REPL is a powerful tool for experimenting with code, managing packages, and quickly accessing documentation or system commands within the same session.

    - In VSCode, go to the search bar and type `Julia: Start REPL` to start the REPL.
    - In your terminal, type `julia` and hit Enter to start the Julia REPL.

- Customization of the REPL
    - Add `OhMyREPL` to your Julia environment by running `] add OhMyREPL` in the REPL.
    - Modify the `startup.jl` file:
        The `startup.jl` file in Julia is an optional file that can be used to execute custom code every time a Julia session starts. It can be useful for setting configurations, loading frequently used packages, or defining custom functions.
            - Location of startup.jl on Different Systems:
                - Linux/macOS:
                    ```
                    ~/.julia/config/startup.jl
                    ```
                - Windows:
                    ```
                    C:\Users\YourUsername\.julia\config\startup.jl
                    ```
                    
- REPL modes:
    - Help mode
    - Shell mode
    - Package mode

- Package management

- Environment setup
    - Julia uses the `Pkg` package manager to manage dependencies and environments.
    - To create a new project, use `]` to enter the package manager mode and then type `generate MyNewProject` to create a new project within the specified directory.
    - Julia uses project-specific environments to manage dependencies by maintaining separate `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files for each environment, ensuring that package versions are isolated and reproducible. You can activate and work within a specific environment using `Pkg.activate("path/to/project")`, allowing for flexible and independent package management across projects.
    - `Pkg.instantiate()` is a Julia function used to install all the dependencies for a project, based on the information stored in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.
        - Here’s what it does:
            - If your project has a `Manifest.toml` file, `Pkg.instantiate()` will install the exact versions of the packages listed there, ensuring that the environment is fully reproduced as specified.
            - If there’s no `Manifest.toml` file, but there’s a `Project.toml`, it will resolve and install the necessary package dependencies based on the `Project.toml` file, generating a new `Manifest.toml` in the process.
    - After doing this in our repo, we can do: `Pkg.status()`, which displays the current status of the project, listing installed packages and their versions.
